# Write a Java program to print numbers between 1 and 100 divisible by 3, 5 and both. 
# Sample Output: 
# Divided by 3: 
# 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 69, 72, 75, 78, 81, 84, 87, 90, 93, 96, 99.
# Divided by 5: 
# 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95.
# Divided by 3 & 5: 
# 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90
